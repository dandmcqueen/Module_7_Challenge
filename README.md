# Module 7 Challenge

This project analyzes housing investment opportunities in the San Francisco area.  Housing units are totaled by year from 2010 to 2016,

along with the sale price per square foot and average gross rent. Data is plotted on interactive maps and analyzed to determine

possible areas to implement a new one-click service to buy and rent properties.
